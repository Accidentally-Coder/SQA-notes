<p>Testers often sense something is wrong when a product “does not meet expectations” - but it’s vague. To be credible and useful, testers should be able to explain where those expectations come from.<br>
This is where <strong>oracle heuristics</strong> come in - they <em>help frame expectations</em> through <em>known sources of consistency.</em></p>

<p>To capture broader patterns observed over time, <strong>three</strong> new heuristics were added, resulting in the updated mnemonic :<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>These heuristics help testers move from a vague “something’s wrong” to a <strong>clear, credible problem report</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They <strong>train testers’ observation and thinking</strong>, guiding them to discover issues based on various expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They remind us that all heuristics are <strong>fallible and context-dependent</strong>—useful for guidance, not strict rules.</p>
